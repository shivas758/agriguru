# Data.gov.in API - Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that the Data.gov.in API is properly configured and working in your app.

---

## üîß Configuration Check

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] `.env` file exists in project root
- [ ] `VITE_DATA_GOV_API_KEY` is set
- [ ] API key is not empty or placeholder
- [ ] No extra spaces or quotes around the key

**How to check:**
```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls .env

# Verify the key is set (don't commit this file!)
# Open .env and look for:
# VITE_DATA_GOV_API_KEY=579b464db66ec23bdd000001cdd3946e44ce4aad7209ff7b23ac571b
```

### 2. API Service File
- [ ] `src/services/marketPriceAPI.js` exists
- [ ] API_KEY is imported from environment
- [ ] BASE_URL is correct
- [ ] fetchMarketPrices method exists

**How to check:**
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls src/services/marketPriceAPI.js

# Verify it contains the correct base URL
# Should have: https://api.data.gov.in/resource/9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070
```

## üß™ Functionality Tests

### Test 1: Basic API Call
- [ ] App starts without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Can type a query in the chat
- [ ] Query is processed by Gemini AI
- [ ] API call is made to Data.gov.in
- [ ] Response is received and displayed

**Test Query:**
```
"What is the price of wheat in Punjab?"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Price cards displayed with min, max, modal prices
- Location information shown
- Date displayed
- No error messages

### Test 2: Caching
- [ ] First query makes API call
- [ ] Second identical query uses cache
- [ ] Response is faster on second query
- [ ] Data is stored in Supabase (if configured)

**Test Query:**
```
Query 1: "What is the price of rice in Tamil Nadu?"
Query 2: "What is the price of rice in Tamil Nadu?" (same query)
```

**Expected Result:**
- First query: ~2000ms response time
- Second query: ~50ms response time (if Supabase enabled)
- Browser console shows "Cache hit" message

### Test 3: Fallback Strategy
- [ ] Query with specific district works
- [ ] Query with unavailable district falls back to state
- [ ] Query with unavailable state shows commodity data
- [ ] Historical data shown when today's data unavailable

**Test Query:**
```
"What is the price of onion in a small village?"
```

**Expected Result:**
- App tries specific location
- Falls back to broader search
- Shows data from nearby markets or state level

### Test 4: Multi-language
- [ ] Can query in Hindi
- [ ] Can query in Tamil
- [ ] Can query in Telugu
- [ ] Response is in same language as query

**Test Queries:**
```
Hindi: "‡§ó‡•á‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à?"
Tamil: "‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øà ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡Æé‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©?"
Telugu: "‡∞ó‡±ã‡∞ß‡±Å‡∞Æ ‡∞ß‡∞∞ ‡∞é‡∞Ç‡∞§?"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Query understood correctly
- Response in same language
- Prices displayed correctly

### Test 5: Voice Input
- [ ] Microphone button works
- [ ] Can speak query
- [ ] Voice is transcribed correctly
- [ ] Query is processed
- [ ] Response is displayed

**Test:**
1. Click microphone button
2. Speak: "What is the price of wheat?"
3. Wait for response

**Expected Result:**
- Voice transcribed to text
- Query processed
- Prices displayed

## üîç Browser Console Checks

### Expected Console Logs

#### Successful API Call:
```
‚úÖ Fetching with filters: {
  api-key: "579b464db...",
  format: "json",
  filters[commodity]: "Wheat",
  filters[state]: "Punjab",
  limit: 100
}
‚úÖ Data fetched successfully
‚úÖ Found 5 records
```

#### Cache Hit:
```
‚úÖ Cache hit for key: wheat_punjab_2025-10-22
‚úÖ Returning cached data
```

#### Fallback:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No results with district filter, trying with state only...
‚úÖ Found data with state filter
```

### Error Messages to Watch For:

#### ‚ùå Invalid API Key:
```
‚ùå Error: 403 Forbidden
‚ùå Invalid API key
```
**Solution:** Check `.env` file, verify API key is correct

#### ‚ùå Network Error:
```
‚ùå Error fetching market prices: Network Error
```
**Solution:** Check internet connection

#### ‚ùå No Data Found:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No data found for query
```
**Solution:** Try broader filters or different commodity

## üìä Performance Checks

### Response Time Benchmarks

| Scenario | Expected Time | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| First query (API call) | 1500-2500ms | [ ] |
| Cached query (Supabase) | 30-100ms | [ ] |
| Historical data query | 50-150ms | [ ] |
| Fallback query | 2000-3000ms | [ ] |

**How to check:**
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Make a query
- Check timing for API calls

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Checks (If Supabase Enabled)

### Supabase Configuration
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is set in `.env`
- [ ] `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set in `.env`
- [ ] `market_price_cache` table exists
- [ ] Table has correct schema

**How to check:**
1. Login to Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Table Editor
3. Check if `market_price_cache` table exists
4. Verify columns: id, cache_key, cached_at, commodity, district, state, market_data

### Cache Data
- [ ] Data is being stored after API calls
- [ ] Can see entries in Supabase table
- [ ] Entries have today's date
- [ ] cache_key format is correct

**How to check:**
1. Make a query in the app
2. Go to Supabase dashboard
3. Open `market_price_cache` table
4. Check for new entry with today's date

---

## üéØ API Key Verification

### Sample Key (Current)
```
