# Fixes Applied - Oct 18, 2025

## Issue: "Paddy price in Chittoor" showing wrong locations

### Problems Identified:
1. ❌ "paddy" commodity not mapped correctly in API
2. ❌ District name "chittoor" not normalized to "Chittoor"
3. ❌ Only showing 3 results when multiple markets exist
4. ❌ Not clearly indicating when data is from different location

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Added Paddy to Commodity Mapping
**File**: `src/services/marketPriceAPI.js`

```javascript
'paddy': 'Paddy(Dhan)(Common)',
```

Now "paddy" correctly maps to the API's commodity name format.

#### 2. Improved District Name Normalization
**File**: `src/services/marketPriceAPI.js`

Added district name mapping for common variations:
```javascript
const districtMap = {
  'chittoor': 'Chittoor',
  'chittor': 'Chittoor',
  'hyderabad': 'Hyderabad',
  'bangalore': 'Bangalore',
  // ... more districts
};
```

#### 3. Increased Results Limit
**File**: `src/App.jsx`

Changed from `limit: 10` to `limit: 50` to fetch more markets.

#### 4. Smart Filtering and Context Messages
**File**: `src/App.jsx`

Added logic to:
- Check if results match the requested district
- Filter to show only matching district data if found
- Show up to 10 markets (increased from 3)
- Add clear message when showing data from different location

```javascript
// Check if results match requested location
const hasMatchingDistrict = requestedDistrict && formattedData.some(item => 
  item.district.toLowerCase().includes(requestedDistrict)
);

// Filter or show all
const displayData = hasMatchingDistrict 
  ? formattedData.filter(item => item.district.toLowerCase().includes(requestedDistrict))
  : formattedData;

// Add context message
if (requestedDistrict && !hasMatchingDistrict) {
  contextMessage = "Note: No data available for Chittoor. Showing paddy prices from other locations:";
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Query: "paddy price in chittoor"

1. **Intent Extraction**: ✅ Correctly extracts `{ commodity: "paddy", district: "chittoor" }`

2. **Normalization**: ✅ Converts to `{ commodity: "Paddy(Dhan)(Common)", district: "Chittoor" }`

3. **API Search**:
   - Tier 1: Search for Paddy in Chittoor district
   - Tier 2: If not found, search Paddy in Andhra Pradesh state
   - Tier 3: If still not found, search all Paddy prices

4. **Smart Display**:
   - If Chittoor data found: Show only Chittoor markets (up to 10)
   - If Chittoor data NOT found: Show other locations with clear note
   - Each price card shows: Market name, District, State

5. **User Feedback**: Clear message explaining why different location is shown

## Data.gov.in API Integration

**YES, the API is being called!** 

The console logs show:
```
Fetching with filters: {
  api-key: '579b464db66ec23bdd000...',
  format: 'json',
  limit: 50,
  filters[commodity]: 'Paddy(Dhan)(Common)',
  filters[district]: 'Chittoor'
}
```

The API returns real government data. If no data exists for Chittoor, it's because:
- The government database doesn't have recent data for that district
- The market data hasn't been updated for that location
- The commodity might not be traded in that specific district

## Testing

Try these queries to see the improvements:

1. **"paddy price in chittoor"** - Now correctly searches for Paddy(Dhan)(Common) in Chittoor
2. **"rice price in hyderabad"** - Shows all markets in Hyderabad
3. **"wheat price in punjab"** - Shows multiple markets across Punjab state
4. **"onion price"** - Shows prices from various locations

## Future Enhancements

To further improve:
1. Add more commodity name variations (e.g., "dhan" → "Paddy(Dhan)(Common)")
2. Implement fuzzy matching for district names
3. Cache frequently searched locations
4. Add date range filtering
5. Show historical price trends
