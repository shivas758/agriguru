# Bug Fixes Summary - October 21, 2025 (5:28 PM)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Supabase 406 Errors - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Database queries were failing with "406 (Not Acceptable)" errors.

**Root Cause:** Missing headers in Supabase client configuration.

**Solution:** Added explicit headers to Supabase client:
```javascript
global: {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}
```

**File:** `src/services/supabaseClient.js`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Working now (user confirmed cached data is fetching)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Market-Wide Queries Fetching Old Data - FIXED
**Problem:** When querying "warangal market prices" (without specific commodity), the app was returning old cached data instead of fetching fresh data.

**Root Cause:** The cache Strategy 2 was checking broader cache results without properly restricting to commodity-specific queries. Market-wide queries were matching old cached entries.

**Solution:** 
- Added check to skip Strategy 2 for market-wide queries (queries without commodity)
- Added logging to indicate when market-wide query is detected
- Ensured only today's cache is checked (`.eq('cache_date', today)`)

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Only use Strategy 2 if we're looking for a specific commodity
if (params.commodity && (params.district || params.market)) {
  // Check broader cache for commodity matches
} else if (!params.commodity) {
  // Skip broader cache search for market-wide queries
  console.log('Market-wide query detected - skipping broader cache search');
}
```

**File:** `src/services/marketPriceCache.js`

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ "castor seed in warangal" ‚Üí Can use cached data from today
- ‚úÖ "warangal market prices" ‚Üí Must fetch fresh data from API (no commodity specified)
- ‚úÖ All cache checks restricted to today's date only

### 3. üîç Images Not Displaying - DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS
**Problem:** Commodity images not showing in price cards, only default icon appears.

**Debugging Steps Taken:**
1. Simplified `getCommodityImagePath()` to return simple path: `/commodities/cabbage.jpg`
2. Added console logging to track:
   - Commodity name
   - Generated image path
   - Image load errors
3. Reduced serial number variations from 100 to 20 for performance

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
getCommodityImagePath(commodityName) {
  const normalizedName = this.normalizeCommodityName(commodityName);
  // Returns: /commodities/cabbage.jpg
  return `${this.basePath}${normalizedName}.jpg`;
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/commodityImageService.js` - Simplified path generation
- `src/components/ChatMessage.jsx` - Added debug logging

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Check browser console for these logs:
   ```
   PriceCard - Commodity: Cabbage
   PriceCard - Image path: /commodities/cabbage.jpg
   PriceCard - Image error: false/true
   Image failed to load: /commodities/cabbage.jpg (if error)
   ```

2. Verify image file exists:
   - Path: `c:\AgriGuru\market-price-app\public\commodities\cabbage.jpg`
   - Or: `c:\AgriGuru\market-price-app\public\commodities\1.cabbage.jpg`

3. Check browser Network tab:
   - Filter by "cabbage"
   - See if image request is made
   - Check response status (404, 200, etc.)

4. Verify image naming:
   - Commodity: "Cabbage" ‚Üí normalized to "cabbage"
   - Expected file: `cabbage.jpg` or `1.cabbage.jpg`

## Testing Checklist

### Cache Behavior
- [ ] Query specific commodity ‚Üí Uses today's cache if available
- [ ] Query market-wide prices ‚Üí Fetches fresh data from API
- [ ] Query with no today's data ‚Üí Shows historical data with badge
- [ ] Verify cache date is always today for fresh queries

### Images
- [ ] Add test image: `public/commodities/cabbage.jpg`
- [ ] Query for cabbage prices
- [ ] Check if image displays
- [ ] Check browser console for logs
- [ ] Verify image path in Network tab

### Historical Data
- [ ] Query commodity with historical data but no today's data
- [ ] Verify "Historical" badge appears
- [ ] Verify date is shown in message
- [ ] Verify correct commodity is shown (not wrong commodity)

## Known Issues

### Image Display Issue
**Status:** Under investigation

**Symptoms:**
- Images not loading, showing default Package icon
- No error in console (need to check with new logging)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Image files not present in `public/commodities/` folder
2. Incorrect file naming (case sensitivity, format)
3. Image path not resolving correctly in Vite dev server
4. Component re-rendering causing state issues

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Default Package icon is shown as fallback
- Functionality not affected, only visual

---

## Next Actions

1. **User to check:**
   - Browser console logs for image debugging
   - Network tab for image requests
   - Verify image files exist in correct location

2. **If images still not working:**
   - Share console logs
   - Share Network tab screenshot
   - Verify file structure

3. **Test market-wide queries:**
   - Try "warangal market prices"
   - Verify it fetches fresh data
   - Check console logs for "Market-wide query detected"

---

## Performance Notes

- Reduced serial number variations from 100 to 20 (80% reduction in path generation)
- Cache now properly restricted to today's date only
- Historical data uses 4-strategy fallback for better coverage
- Supabase queries optimized with proper headers
